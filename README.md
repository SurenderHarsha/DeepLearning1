# DeepLearning1
This is the repo for the first assignment of deep learning at RUG.
We use Python, Pytorch in Jupyter Notebook to run our experiments
Dataset is CIFAR-10 which comes bundled with Pytorch.
The different settings of experiments are run , by changing the optimizers in the cells and storing the validation and training values after training.
The code to augment data is available in the beginning.
